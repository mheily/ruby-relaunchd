How are sockets passed through to jails?

Here's the flow of events for a hypothetical webserver:
1. In the main system, launchd creates the listening socket on port 80
2. A client connects to port 80.
3. launchd starts the corresponding jail.
4. launchd calls fork(2) and allows the child process to inherit 
   the socket descriptor.
5. The launchd child process calls jail_attach(2) to put itself into
   the jail.
6. The launchd child process calls exec(2) to execute the webserver command.
7. The webserver process calls accept(2) on the inherited socket descriptor
   and services the client request.
