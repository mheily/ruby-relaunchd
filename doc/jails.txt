Notes on using FreeBSD jails:

* Need to install the ports tree via:
sudo ezjail-admin install -p
  ^^^ could automatically check that this was done
  ^^^ also this takes up a lot of space, might be better to use packages

* Need to setup pf.conf to do NAT. This rule should work:
	nat on vtnet0 from 127.0.0.0/8 to any -> (vtnet0)
