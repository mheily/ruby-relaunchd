.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm 
manages processes, both for the system as a whole and for individual users.
The primary and preferred interface to
.Nm
is via the
.Xr launchctl 1
tool which (among other options) allows the user or administrator to load and unload jobs.
Where possible, it is preferable for jobs to launch on demand based on criteria specified
in their respective configuration files.
.Pp
At some point in the boot process
.Nm
is invoked by the underlying init system. 
.Sh ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Pa LAUNCHD_SOCKET

.Sh NOTES
In the
.Nm launchd
lexicon, a "daemon" is, by definition, a system-wide service of which there is one instance for all clients. An "agent" is a service that runs on
a per-user basis. Daemons should not attempt to display UI or interact directly with a user's login session. Any and all work that involves interacting
with a user should be done through agents.
